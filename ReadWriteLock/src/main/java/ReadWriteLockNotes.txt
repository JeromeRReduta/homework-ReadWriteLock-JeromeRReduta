ReadWriteLock Notes:

1) Lock funcs - readLock & writeLock
	Work identically, but follow different rules

	How they work:

		lock():
		
			Wait until no active writers (readLock)/writers and readers (writeLock) 
			
			increase # of active readers/writers

			writeLock only: set writerThread to current thread

		unlock():
			

			Decrease # of active readers (readLock)/writres (writeLock)
			notifies all waiting threads if necessary

			writeLock only: sets writerThread to null


What I Learned (thanks to https://howtodoinjava.com/java/multi-threading/wait-notify-and-notifyall-methods/):
	Learned from above website general format for how to write notifyAll():

		synchronized(lock):
			doStuff()
			lock.notifyAll() // NOT Thread.currentThread().notifyAll()
